# Task

Try to create a simple blackjack game with these specifications:
    - Game must start without needing the used to ask
    - Game must be able to restart
    - Game must stop once the user has blackjack or has busted
    - Game must show the sum of user card values
    - Game must notify the user that they've won or lost
    - Game must notify the drawn card to the user
    - Ace card can be valued 1 or 11; for extra effort you can allow the user to choose which value they'd prefer (mine only counts it as 11)
