# JavaScript Training Session

This is a repository meant for me to review and improve on my JavaScript skills. I'm defining some small projects and building them using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I will provide a README.md file in each mini projects folder to define a set of goals that you must achieve. After completing each mini project, you can compare your results with mine. Star the repository if you feel like this might be something useful to you and you might use it now or sometime in the future.

## Current beginner level projects
- A simple counter (sheeper)
- A simple blackjack game
